= Foreword

I am Niels Stunnebrink, currently third-year student pursuing studies in embedded and computer science course at Avans University of applied sciences. The root of this research document originates from a curiosity point of view while also trying to improve my personal skills.

As the author of this report, i have always been interested in making my own video game because i have always been playing games i wanted to find out how to build one. However, not only do i wanted to build my game i wanted to try build everything on my own, so the game engine first and then try making a game with that engine as well.


I hope that this document provides a insightful, informative, and a different way of looking at the game engine. If there are questions or i made a mistake you can contact me at {email}.
